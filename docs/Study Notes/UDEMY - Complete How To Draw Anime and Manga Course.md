## Manga Style Elements

- Comparing 3/4 view for looking at head shape
	- More straight/flat eye socket indention than realistic for far side of face
	- flatter nose 
	- lower cheek/jaw area
	- These differences are really there to stylize the head/face which are the most expressive and emphasized part of Manga drawings. Goal is more symbolic and simple shapes and proportions to make expressions readable and clear.
- Head Shape Styles
	- Feminine: Curvier cheek into chin + point chin
	- Younger male: Curvier cheek into chin + a bit more structure/definition to chin
	- Masculine: A more angled and abrupt transition from cheek to chin, flatter chin line
	- Older Masculine: Same as masculine but an even longer flat chin line
	- Smaller/younger/thinner/feminine characters: thinner neck
	- Bigger/older/thicker/masculine characters: thicker neck

### Fundamentals of Eyes
- Want to start with upper lid line.  This is typically darker than other lines in the eye. Want to make it a bit thicker and maybe good to go over it with multiple lines
	- Can add some angled, but more horizontal lines coming off of this as some stylized eyelash
	- Less emphasis on lashes for male characters
- Next, add the outer corner line something maybe thick at top and thin at bottom
- Next is eyelid crease on, a short line appearing on the inside of the eye tat goes at an angle to slightly above the upper lid line
- Next is iris shape, maybe thicken the lines of origin coming from the upper lid line which can represent idea of upper lid shadow
- Lower lid line is often either left out or just a short line along the bottom of the iris 
- Inner corner line usually left off, and instead we just transition from eyelid white to skin color
- Next is pupil, can go ahead and add some shading here with something like cross hatching
- Can shade in iris now, typically lighter than iris shading
- Shade upper lid by marking a space and shading it in
- Add a highlight which could be iris only, pupil only, iris and pupil, eye white and pupil and could be any shape
- Variations on any of all of these guidelines can be used to create unique style and characters
